            This space is meant to be a creative outlet for me to document memories such as my travel and living 
            experiences. Documenting these experiences has been something I have wanted to do for awhile, and I found 
            it most meaningful for myself to host it here. This section is currently a work-in-progress; 
            come back and check on it later!
